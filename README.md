## Hi there, I'm Márcio 👋


## About me

- 🎯 I'm mainly focused in backend devolopment and mobile development.

- 💻 Currently I'm working as .NET 5 C# Backend Developer.

- 🌱 I've done most of my mobile projects using React Native. But lately I've been trying out Flutter and Native Android development as new ways to improve myself.

- 📚 Most of my graduation projects were made using Java. So I have some experience with Maven, Hibernate, SpringBoot and other backend technologies that uses Java aswell.
