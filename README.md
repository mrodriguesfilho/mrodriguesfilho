## Hi there, I'm Márcio 👋


## About me

- 💻 I'm a Back-End Engineer and currently I'm working with .NET 5/6, ASP.NET and C# as main technologies.

- 🌱 As a developer, I'm always looking for new technologies and new ways to solve problems more efficiently. Therefore I tend to take a lot of different courses and online training, particularly those with a Back-End made with NodeJS.

- ❤ I'm also very fond of Mobile Development and I've done most of my mobile projects using React Native. But lately I've been trying out Flutter as a new way to improve myself.

- 📚 Most of my CS degree projects were made using Java. So I also have some experience with Maven, Hibernate, SpringBoot and other Back-End technologies that uses Java aswell.
