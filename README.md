## Hi there, I'm MÃ¡rcio ðŸ‘‹


## About me

- ðŸ’» Today I'm mainly focused in mobile development.
- ðŸŒ± I've done most of my mobile projects using React Native. But lately I've been trying out Flutter and Native Android development as new ways to improve myself before I dive down into a tech path.
- ðŸ“š Most of my graduation projects were made using Java. So I have some experience with Maven, Hibernate, SpringBoot and other backend technologies that uses Java.
