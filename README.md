## Hi there, I'm MÃ¡rcio ðŸ‘‹


## About me

- ðŸ’» I'm a Back-End Engineer and currently I'm working with C# and .NET as main technologies.

- ðŸŒ± As a developer, I'm always looking for new technologies and new ways to solve problems more efficiently. Therefore I tend to take a lot of different courses and online training, particularly those with a Back-End made with NodeJS and GoLang.

- ðŸ“š Most of my CS degree projects were made using Java. So I also have some experience with Maven, Hibernate, SpringBoot and other Back-End technologies that uses Java aswell.
